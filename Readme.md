# Welcome To Sprite Engine

This Project is a simple **2D Game Engine** designed to be fully understand by one Person.

## Tools used

- **Dear ImGui** 
- **Rene** 

## Features

- **UI Editor**
- **Box Collision Detection**
- **Parent-Child Collision Stopping** 
- **Physics**
- **Animations (also supporting UI editor now)**
- **Scripting with C++** 
- **Project Creator**

----    
## Enhancements
- **Sound Manager**
- **Automatic project builder**
---

## Getting Started

The engine calls the only 1 update and 1 Start Method of the "Game" class, if you create a new Script you need to
call the update method from the script in the "Game" class. If you want to share Instances simply pass them in the 
update methods or set a pointer to it in the start method. You can get acces to a sprite by calling the myPtr = s2d::Sprite::getSpriteByName() 
method. Now you are able to use all kinds of features with the sprite. Please not that the engine does still have alot of bugs!

You can get started by downloading the Engine folder [here](https//github.com)

You can find a Introduction to the engine on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnCD5dKhpmg)

1. **Create a Project**

    In the folder open the .exe and create a new project by clicking on the create button. 

    A File Dialog will open, select where u want to create the project and hit the '**+**' button.

    All the files from the **template** folder will be automatically copied to the location the user selected.

    The folder will have the name the user selected, the **.sln** file and the **.exe** wont have the same name as the **project name**. 

    I'am **looking to add** a feature where u can build the project in a folder with it's name, containing all the dll's and **renamed files**. 

2. **How Do I Script My Sprites?**

   In the Game Engine you can right click in the Asset folder and select **New -> C++ Script**, this will create a new Script containing the **update** and **start** functions.
   (You can find the docs the the functions in the engine)

   You can create a new **Sprite ptr** in your class:

    ```C++
    class Game : public s2d::Base
    {
    private:
        Sprite* m_sprite;
    }

    ```
   You can give the **Sprite ptr** a address by calling the **s2d::Sprite::getSpriteByName("name");** function, to search for a sprite with the name **'name'**. This will return a **'nullptr'** or the adress to this sprite.

    ```C++
    void Game::start()
    {
        this->m_sprite = Sprite::getSpriteByName("name");
    }
    ```

    Finally you can change the properties of the sprite using the **update** function for example: 


    ```C++
    void Game::update()
    {
        if(Input::onKeyHold(KeyBoardCode::A))
        {
            this->m_sprite.transform.position.x -= 700 * Time::deltaTime;
        }
    }
    ```
